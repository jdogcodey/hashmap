# hashmap

Following the Hashmap project on The Odin Project.

Building a Hashmap class or factory function (unsure of which I will use yet).

Methods/functions I will also be creating:

- hash(key) - takes a key and produces a hash code with it
- set(key, value)
- get(key)
- has(key)
- remove(key)
- length()
- clear()
- keys()
- values()
- entries()
