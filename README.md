# hashmap

Following the Hashmap project on The Odin Project.

Building a Hashmap class or factory function (unsure of which I will use yet).

Methods/functions I will also be creating:

- hash(key) - takes a key and produces a hash code with it
- set(key, value)
- get(key)
- has(key)
- remove(key)
- length()
- clear()
- keys()
- values()
- entries()

AFTER FINISHING

I chose to write this using factory functions and copied over my code from
my previous LinkedLists project which was class-based.

I did this so that I could try writing similar code but in both methods
as I felt like both were a bit weak and I wasn't fully sure what I was doing.

I've tried to add comments throughout to explain what I am doing - going to
do this more going forward.

There are some functions that are a bit convoluted I feel like but on the whole
I am pretty happy with how this turns out.

I did a decent amount of testing and think it is all functioning as it should
be including edge cases.
